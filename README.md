This is an add-on field for the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. This field allows you to capture YouTube data from a single input field. You or your clients can enter in either the full YouTube URL or just the YouTube Video ID. In the admin, youâ€™ll instantly be presented with the video so you can make sure you have linked up the correct one.

## How to Use Video:

The YouTube Video field has 6 different return values: Embed, Video Object, YouTube ID, URL, Thumbnail, Thumbnail Object. The Video Object pings the YouTube API to get you specific information about the video like Title, Description, Number of Views and more.

This is a great WordPress plugin for developers as it gives a quick start when clients ask to add videos and don't exactly know how to do it. This way you can simply give them a field and almost no matter what they insert you'll be able to grab the YouTube ID. [Documentation](https://halgatewood.com/docs/plugins/acf-youtube-field)

This plugin works with Advanced Custom Fields version 4 and 5.
